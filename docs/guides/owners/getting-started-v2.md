# Diving Into the Deep End: Getting started with Oxide for Rust

## Oxide? What's That and Why Should I Care?

Glad you asked! Oxide (you might also know it as uMod) is the Swiss Army Knife of Rust server enhancements. It's like strapping a jet engine to your bicycle, if your bicycle was a Rust server and the jet engine was a mind-bogglingly flexible modding framework.

In short, Oxide gives your Rust server superpowers. We're talking about the ability to customize gameplay, add new features, and create a unique player experience that will have folks flocking to your server faster than you can say "naked and afraid."

Did we mention that Oxide is an open-source project that's been supporting Rust modding for over 10 years? Yep, you're standing on the shoulders of giants here.
