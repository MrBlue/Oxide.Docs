# Getting started with plugin development

Welcome to the Oxide Modding Framework for Rust! This guide will help you get started with developing your own plugins using this powerful framework.

### What is Oxide?

Oxide is a powerful modding framework for the game Rust, allowing developers to create custom gameplay mechanics, features, and systems. With Oxide, the possibilities for enhancing Rust are nearly limitless.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of programming in C#. If you're new to C#, consider checking out [Microsoft's C# Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for learning resources.
- Familiarity with Unity game development. Unity's [Learning Resources](https://learn.unity.com/) can help you get up to speed.
- A copy of the latest version of the game Rust installed on your system. If you're interested in using the staging branch of Rust, you can follow [these instructions](https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/using-the-staging-branch) to set it up.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To start developing plugins for Oxide, you'll need a development environment. We recommend using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider. These IDEs provide useful features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools that will make your development process much smoother.

#### Visual Studio

1. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. During installation, make sure to select the ".NET desktop development" workload.
3. Once installed, you can open your plugin's .cs file with Visual Studio.

#### VS Code

1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) for VS Code.
3. Open your plugin's .cs file with VS Code.

#### Rider

1. Download and install [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/).
2. Open your plugin's .cs file with Rider.

### Downloading Oxide

To start developing, you'll need to download the Oxide modding framework. You can find the latest release on the [Oxide GitHub repository](https://github.com/OxideMod/Oxide.Rust). Download the source code zip file and extract it to a location of your choice.

### Creating Your First Plugin

Now that you have your development environment set up and Oxide downloaded, you're ready to create your first plugin! In the next section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a simple plugin.

### Joining the Community

The Rust gaming and Oxide modding communities are vibrant and welcoming places. Whether you're looking for help, want to share your work, or just want to connect with other developers, there are plenty of resources available. Remember to always respect community guidelines and norms.

### What's Next?

In the upcoming sections, we'll dive deeper into setting up your development environment, including adding commonly used dependencies. We'll also guide you through creating your first plugin, and exploring the various libraries and components of Oxide. Best practices for Oxide plugin development and solutions to common issues you might encounter will also be covered.
